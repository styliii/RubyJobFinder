Scrape websites that have ruby jobs, and save it into a database

I need the database to at least include:
job header
company
summary
link to apply
salary
link to original posting
industry
equity?
posted date

Choose site to scrape
http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs?searchTerm=ruby+on+rails&location=10003&range=60
